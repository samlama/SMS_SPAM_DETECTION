SMS spam detection involves the identification of unwanted or unsolicited text messages (SMS) commonly referred to as spam. It is a classification task where machine learning algorithms are trained to distinguish between legitimate (ham) and spam messages. The process typically includes preprocessing the text data, converting it into a numerical format, and training a classifier, often using techniques like Naive Bayes. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports are used to assess the model's performance. The "SMS Spam Collection" dataset is commonly employed for training and testing such models, and scikit-learn is a popular Python library for implementing SMS spam detection algorithms.
