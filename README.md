SMS spam detection involves the identification of unwanted or unsolicited text messages (SMS) commonly referred to as spam. It is a classification task where machine learning algorithms are trained to distinguish between legitimate (ham) and spam messages. The process typically includes preprocessing the text data, converting it into a numerical format, and training a classifier, often using techniques like Naive Bayes. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports are used to assess the model's performance. The "SMS Spam Collection" dataset is commonly employed for training and testing such models, and scikit-learn is a popular Python library for implementing SMS spam detection algorithms.
Steps for SMS Spam Detection:
Data Loading:

Import the necessary libraries.
Load the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
Data Preprocessing:

Convert labels to binary values (0 for 'ham' and 1 for 'spam').
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Text Vectorization:

Use a CountVectorizer to convert text data into a bag-of-words representation.
Fit and transform the training set.
Transform the testing set.
Algorithm: Naive Bayes Classifier:

Train a Naive Bayes classifier (Multinomial Naive Bayes is commonly used for text classification).
Fit the model using the vectorized training data and corresponding labels.
Prediction:

Make predictions on the vectorized test set.
Evaluation:

Calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess the model's performance.
